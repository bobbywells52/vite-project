## Repo setup

1. To clone the repo into a directory named `vite-project`, open a terminal window and run the following command

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bobbywells52/vite-project.git vite-project

   cd vite-project
   ```

2. Install the prerequisite node packages by running `npm install`. You should see a `node_modules` directory get generated with the relevant node dependencies needed for the app to build for development.
3. Run `npm run dev` to launch the app locally. By default, vite should run the app on `http://localhost:5173/`. If it is not running on that port, check your terminal output to see the port that it is running on.
